# server-explorer

This project is to prepare a server free application to explore server data with some functionalities such as login, sorting, searching.

# Highlights of the project setup

### This repo is setup using latest tools like:

1. ### vite -
   Is a build tool that aims to provide a faster and leaner development experience for modern web projects, it uses esbuild which way more faster than any other build tools [https://vitejs.dev/guide/]
2. ### react with typescript -
   Using Typescript to build our React applications will make our react applications more predictable as we will be able to catch a lot of errors at runtime (during compilation). [https://create-react-app.dev/docs/adding-typescript/]
   **some refs to answer why? :**
   [https://www.sitepoint.com/react-with-typescript-best-practices/]
   [https://www.section.io/engineering-education/building-a-react-app-with-typescript/#:~:text=Using%20Typescript%20to%20build%20our,at%20runtime%20(during%20compilation)]
3. ### redux-toolkit with typescript -
   Redux Toolkit makes it easier to write good Redux applications and speeds up development, by baking in our recommended best practices, providing good default behaviors, catching mistakes, and allowing you to write simpler code. Redux Toolkit is beneficial to all Redux users regardless of skill level or experience [https://redux-toolkit.js.org/usage/usage-with-typescript]
4. ### tailwind css -
   Tailwind CSS works by scanning all of your HTML files, JavaScript components, and any other templates for class names, generating the corresponding styles and then writing them to a static CSS file.
   It's fast, flexible, and reliable â€” with zero-runtime. [https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation/using-postcss]
5. ### testing-library -
   The React Testing Library is a very light-weight solution for testing React components. It provides light utility functions on top of react-dom and react-dom/test-utils, in a way that encourages better testing practice [https://testing-library.com/docs/react-testing-library/intro/]
6. ### husky -
   Husky improves your commits.You can use it to lint your commit messages, run tests, lint code, etc... when you commit or push. [https://typicode.github.io/husky/#/]
7. ### prettier -
   An opinionated code formatter, It removes all original styling\* and ensures that all outputted code conforms to a consistent style. [https://prettier.io/docs/en/index.html]
   **why? :**
   You press save and code is formatted
   No need to discuss style in code review
   Saves you time and energy
8. ### pnpm -
   Saving disk space and boosting installation speed, save a lot of space on your disk proportional to the number of projects and dependencies, and you have a lot faster installations! [https://pnpm.io/next/motivation]
